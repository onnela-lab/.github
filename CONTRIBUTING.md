## How to contribute to the development of Beiwe

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability.** Instead send an email to <onnela.lab@gmail.com>. 

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub either for [Beiwe Android front-end](https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-android/issues), [Beiwe iOS front-end](https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-ios/issues) or [Beiwe back-end](https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-backend/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one in the relevant repository. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Beiwe will generally not be accepted.

Thanks!
